Fundamentals:
As a user, I want to roll play as Harry Potter and shoot Avada Kadavra's at 8-bit Pikachus.  I want the pikachus to spawn randomly from various fixed spawn points.  When clicked, the pikachus disappear.  As a user, I want end-game feedback on how I performed.

If Time:
As the first user, I want stats stored after my round.  Then, prompt another user to play.  At the end, I want the game to compare the stats of the first and 2nd user.
